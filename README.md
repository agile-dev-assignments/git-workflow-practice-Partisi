## Interesting Points/Takeaways
The article discusses two key development strategies: Git Flow Development vs. Trunk-Based Development. By giving clear standards with both pros and cons to each development, this article shows a spotlight on how different organizations will have different developmental needs and must adopt processes to best fit their own needs, rather than following a strict method for a 'one size fits all' developmental process. In particular, organizations should consider their team size, management style, emphasis on speed, emphasis on quality, team experience, trust, and budget amongst others, before deciding on a specific development process for their project.

What I find personally interesting about this article is that it further proves that software engineering really does have a lot of different styles and approaches when solving a problem. I feel that many developers have gone into Computer Science particularly because of this freedom of choice to harness their own methodology to solve problems. Git Flow vs. Trunk based development emphasizes this point where it's not only the code that requires creative, free thinking for problem-solving, but also at an engineering/managerial level as well. Mr. Gadzinowski's article not only articulates this idea, but does so at an introductory level to really help software developers understand the importance of being robust problem-solvers.

Learning by the books isn't enough, and developers must be adaptable and learn their team's strengths and weakness to truly excel in their development.
